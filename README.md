Olist E-commerce Business Intelligence Analysis 📊
📌 Project Overview
This project provides a deep-dive analysis of the Olist E-commerce Public Dataset. The goal is to evaluate operational performance, financial health, and customer satisfaction to provide actionable insights for executive management. The analysis covers the entire customer journey—from order placement and payment to logistics and post-purchase reviews.

🎯 Project Objectives
Logistics Optimization: Identify bottlenecks in the shipping process (Sellers vs. Carriers).

Financial Analysis: Analyze revenue trends, Average Order Value (AOV), and payment methods.

Customer Satisfaction: Calculate Net Promoter Score (NPS) and analyze the impact of delivery delays on reviews.

Content-Sales Correlation: Evaluate how product descriptions and photos impact sales and ratings.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI: Data modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and interactive dashboarding.

SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and complex aggregations (Payment analysis, AOV, etc.).

Excel/CSV: Raw data source.

📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)
Total Revenue: $15.84M

Average Review Score: 4.09 / 5.00

Average Order Value (AOV): $160.58

Time Delivery Rate: 92%

Average Carrier Transit Time: 9.28 Days

Net Promoter Score (NPS): 43.09

🔍 Dashboard Pages & Insights
1. Executive Summary
A high-level overview of the company’s performance, showing revenue trends and geographical distribution of delivery delays.

2. Logistics & SLA Analysis
Finding: The primary bottleneck is the Carrier Transit Time (9.28 days) rather than the Seller Preparation Time (2.71 days).

Insight: 75% of delivery time is spent with the carrier, directly impacting customer satisfaction.

3. Financial & Payment Analysis
Finding: 78.34% of payments are made via Credit Card.

Insight: Negotiating better processing fees with payment gateways could significantly increase net profit.

4. Customer Loyalty (NPS)
Classification: Customers are categorized into Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), and Detractors (0-6).

Insight: There is a clear negative correlation between delivery delay and review scores. Reducing delays is the fastest way to increase NPS.

5. Content & Sales Correlation
Finding: Products with more photos and longer descriptions tend to have higher sales and better ratings.

Insight: High-selling categories with low photo counts represent "Content Gaps" that can be easily optimized for more revenue.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
Carrier Optimization: Renegotiate contracts with carriers in high-delay regions to reduce the 9.28-day transit average.

Realistic SLAs: Adjust the "Estimated Delivery Date" provided to customers to match actual performance, reducing frustration.

Freight Cost Management: Reprice products in categories where the Freight-to-Price Ratio is too high (e.g., small, heavy items).

Service Recovery: Deploy a dedicated team to respond to Detractors (1-6 stars) within 24 hours to mitigate negative brand sentiment.

Content Enrichment: Launch a "Photos First" program for top-selling categories to ensure every product has at least 3-5 high-quality images.
